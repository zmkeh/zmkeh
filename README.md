# About me

I’ve come quite a way in this hacking game—maybe even found me rhythm—but I’d never peg myself as an expert. Truth be told, who can, in this line of work? The deeper you dig, the more you see it’s like some endless labyrinth, layers on layers that no one bloke’s ever gonna fully map out. Those calling themselves “leet” might just be blissfully unaware of the gaps in their own knowledge, or maybe they’ve yet to feel the proper weight of its complexity.

My way of learning? Not exactly by the book, more like a bit of a mad dash, really. Found a niche that piqued me curiosity and just threw meself right in. Thought I’d start with game security—seemed like a decent jumping-off point, if you ask me. But soon enough, it was web security that grabbed me by the collar and wouldn’t let go. There’s something strangely captivating about it, this blend of order and chaos—it pulled me in deeper than anything else.
